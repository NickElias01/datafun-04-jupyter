# Iris Dataset Analysis Project

This project analyzes the famous **Iris dataset** using Python, pandas, and seaborn for data visualization. It explores the distribution and relationships of various features of iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Project Overview

The notebook performs the following:
- Data loading and inspection.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using summary statistics and visualizations.
- Data transformation and feature engineering (e.g., calculating sepal area).
- Visualizing data distributions using histograms, box plots, and pair plots.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that the following software is installed:
- Python (version 3.8 or above)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   First, open a terminal and run the following command to clone this repository to your local machine:
   
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/NickElias01/datafun-04-jupyter
   ```


2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    - Be sure to navigate to the correct directory within your terminal


3. **Create a virtual environment**:
    - Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment for dependencies. Run the following commands:
    ``` 
    .venv\Scripts\activate  (Windows) 
    ```
    ``` 
    source .venv/bin/activate  (macOS/Linux) 
    ```

4. **Install required packages**:
    - Install the project dependencies listed in requirements.txt:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


5. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
    - Start Jupyter Notebook in your terminal:

    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```    
    - This will open Jupyter in your browser. From there, you can open the notebook file (nickelias_eda.ipynb) and run the analysis.


### Instructions for Use
Each cell in the Jupyter notebook is meant to be executed in sequence.
Follow the markdown instructions and comments inside the notebook to understand the flow of analysis.
